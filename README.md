# What is this about?
icoptimizer remake is an Electron-based project that recreates the previously made icoptimizer while utilizing a better UI and more customizability options.

# Why?
icoptimizer was created to improve Windows performance while maintaining almost all of its functionality.
I developed the program because other optimizers are either ineffective or overly complicated.
You can use icoptimizer to optimize your in-game performance and reduce latency.
For a more lightweight version use the original icoptimizer (might be outdated)
